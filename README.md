# European Leagues Data Analysis 📊⚽
### 📝Description
Welcome to the European League Data Analysis repository! Here, I dive into the [European Soccer Database from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer), performing complex SQL queries that involve Common Table Expressions (CTEs), table transformations, SQL functions, and more. This dataset encompasses detailed information about matches, teams, players, and various other aspects of European soccer.



### 📋 Existing Queries
#### Team Performance Per Season:
This query shows team performance per season, including the percentage of wins, rankings, and average goals scored.

#### Data Initialization for Analysis:
This query is used to initialize data analysis of the dataset. Subsequent queries will modify this initial setup for reporting purposes.

#### Table Creation for Performance Analysis:
These queries create tables to analyze team performance across all seasons and leagues in the dataset. The tables include information such as winning percentage, total goals, and average goals for home, away, and overall matches, which are essential for evaluating club results.



### 🚧Project Status
This project is currently in development. I am continually adding new queries and refining existing ones to provide deeper insights. Stay tuned for more updates!
